It consists of a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).$$\frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}$$A decimal is a way to represent a fraction.Decimals are written with a decimal point (.) and a sequence of digits.Decimals are often used to represent fractions in a more convenient and readable form.An approximation is a value that is close to, but not exactly equal to, a given value.Approximations are often used when exact values are difficult or impossible to obtain.Note:Fractions can be converted to decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator.Approximations can be expressed as fractions or decimals, and they can be rounded to a specific number of decimal places or significant figures.IndicesIndices provide a shorthand for repeated multiplication of the same number. The laws of indices guide their operations:Product of Powers: $a^m a^n = a^{m+n}$Power of a Power: $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$Power of a Product: $(ab)^m = a^m b^m$Zero Index: $a^0 = 1$ (for $a \neq 0$)Negative Index: $a^{-n} = 1/a^n$Fractional Index: $a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$Standard Form: A number is in standard form if written as $a \times 10^n$ where $1 \le a < 10$ and $n$ is an integer.LogarithmsLogarithms are the inverse of indices and help find the power needed for a base to produce a given value:$$y = 10^k \iff k = \log_{10}(y)$$Properties:Product Rule: $\log(ab) = \log a + \log b$Quotient Rule: $\log(a/b) = \log a - \log b$Power Rule: $\log(a^b) = b \log a$Change of Base: $\log_a x = \frac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}$Types: Common logarithm ($\log_{10}$) and natural logarithm ($\ln$)Common Logarithm ($\log_{10}$): base 10Natural Logarithm ($\ln$): base $e$ (approximately 2.718)Sequence and SeriesSequence: Ordered list of numbers, each called a term (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...).Series: Sum of sequence terms (e.g., 1+2+4+8=15).Arithmetic Progression (AP): Sequence with constant difference $d$.Formula: $U_n = a + (n - 1)d$where:$U_n =$ $n$th term$a =$ first term$n =$ term number$d =$ common differenceGeometric Progression (GP): Sequence with constant ratio $r$.Formula: $U_n = a \times r^{n-1}$where:$U_n =$ $n$th term$a =$ first term$n =$ term number$r =$ common ratioSetsA set is a collection of distinct elements, denoted { } and separated by commas.Types of Sets:Universal Set (U): All possible elementsFinite Set: Limited elements, e.g., {1,2,3}Infinite Set: Unlimited elements, e.g., {1,2,3,...}Subset ($\subseteq$): All elements are in another setEmpty Set ($\emptyset$): No elementsDisjoint Sets: No common elements ($\cap = \emptyset$)Common Symbols:$\in$ (element of): indicates that an element is a member of a set, e.g., $1 \in A$$\notin$ (not element of): indicates that an element is not a member of a set, e.g., $2 \notin B$$\subseteq$ (subset): indicates that one set is a subset of another, e.g., $A \subseteq B$$\supseteq$ (superset): indicates that one set is a superset of another, e.g., $B \supseteq A$Venn Diagrams are used to show set relationships. They consist of overlapping circles, each representing a set.Logical ReasoningSimple Statements: A simple statement is a statement that can be either true (T) or false (F). e.g., "It is raining." (T or F)Negation of Statements: The negation of a statement is the opposite of the original statement. e.g., $\neg$(It is raining) = It is not raining.Implications: An implication is a statement of the form "If-Then". e.g., "If it rains, then the ground is wet."Use of Symbols:Logic uses symbols to represent statements and logical operations:$\sim P$: Negation of $P$$P \wedge Q$: Conjunction ($P$ and $Q$)$P \vee Q$: Disjunction ($P$ or $Q$)$P \rightarrow Q$: Implication (If $P$, then $Q$)$P \leftrightarrow Q$: Equivalence ($P$ if and only if $Q$)Venn Diagram Relationships:Set A and Set B (Separate): Disjoint setsCircle B inside Circle A: Set B is a subset of set AShaded overlapping area: $A \cap B$ (The intersection of sets A and B)Shaded both circles: $A \cup B$ (The union of sets A and B)Shaded A but not B: $A - B$Shaded outside the intersection: $\overline{A \cap B}$Positive and Negative Integers, Rational NumbersIntegers are whole numbers, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction where both the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero.The four basic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Rational numbers can be represented as points on a number line.Notation:Natural numbers: $N = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$Integers: $Z = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$Rational numbers: $Q = \left\{ \text{all numbers written as } \frac{a}{b}, \text{ where } a \text{ and } b \text{ are integers and } b \neq 0 \right\}$Note: Every natural number belongs to the set of integers, and every integer is included among rational numbers.SurdsA surd, also known as a radical, is the root of a number that cannot be simplified into a whole number or a rational number. In simpler terms, it is a number written using the radical symbol ($\sqrt{}$).Simplifying surds: Writing them in simplest form so no perfect square remains under the radical.Rationalization: Eliminating a surd from the denominator of a fraction.Surds in form $a\sqrt{b}$: $a$ is rational, $b$ is a positive integer (e.g., $2\sqrt{5}$).Basic Operations on Surds:Addition and Subtraction: $3\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}$Multiplication: $2\sqrt{3} \times 4\sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{15}$Division: $\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{2\sqrt{5}} = 3\sqrt{2}$MatricesOrder and Notation: A matrix is a rectangular arrangement organized into rows and columns.

Mathematics Stock NoteTopic 2: Algebraic ProcessesAlgebraic ExpressionsForming Algebraic Expressions from Given SituationsConverting a worded problem or real-life situation into an algebraic expression requires the following steps:Recognising the unknown quantities and assigning variables such as $x$ or $y$.Converting words into mathematical operations. For example:"The sum of a number and 5" becomes $x + 5$"Twice a number" is written as $2x$"The difference between a number and 7" is written as $x - 7$Combining terms appropriately according to how the problem is structured.Example:If a question states, "John has three times as many apples as Tom, and Tom has $x$ apples," then the number of apples John has can be written as $3x$.Evaluating Algebraic ExpressionsTo evaluate an algebraic expression, replace the variable with the given value and carry out the required operations.Example:Given the expression $2x + 5$ and $x = 4$.$$2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13$$Therefore, the value of $2x + 5$ when $x = 4$ is 13.Basic Operations on Algebraic ExpressionsThese include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of algebraic terms. In each case, like terms—terms with the same variables raised to the same powers—must be collected together.ExpansionExpansion involves removing brackets by multiplying each term inside the bracket using the distributive law, for example:$$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$This process helps to simplify expressions so that further operations or evaluations are easier to perform.FactorisationFactorisation is the opposite of expansion. It involves expressing an expression as a product of simpler factors. This may include:Taking out a common factorFactorising quadratic expressionsSolving Linear EquationsA linear equation is one in which each term is either a constant or a constant multiplied by a single variable, and the highest power of the variable is 1. Solving such an equation means finding the value of the variable.Linear Equations in One VariableThese equations involve only one variable, usually $x$, and are typically written in the form $ax + b = c$. To solve, constants are moved to one side of the equation and the variable is isolated.Example:Solve $3x + 5 = 11$.Subtract 5 from both sides to get $3x = 6$.Divide by 3 to obtain $x = 2$.Linear Equations in Two VariablesThese consist of two equations containing two variables, commonly $x$ and $y$. Solving simultaneous linear equations means finding values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations at the same time.Common methods include:Substitution: Rearrange one equation and substitute into the other.Elimination: Add or subtract equations to remove one variable.Example:Solve:$x + y = 5$$2x - y = 1$Solution (Elimination):Adding the equations gives $3x = 6$, so $x = 2$.Substitute $x = 2$ into $x + y = 5$ to find $y = 3$.Hence, $x = 2$ and $y = 3$.Changing the Subject of a FormulaThis process involves rearranging a formula so that a different variable becomes the subject. The aim is to isolate the required variable on one side of the equation.Example:Given $A = lw$, make $w$ the subject.Divide both sides by $l$ to obtain $w = \frac{A}{l}$.SubstitutionSubstitution means replacing a variable in an equation or formula with a known value or another expression. This method is useful when the value of one variable is already known.Example:If $y = 3x + 2z$ and $x = 4$, substitute 4 for $x$:$$y = 3(4) + 2z = 12 + 2z$$(Note: If $z$ were also known, say $z=1$, then $y = 12 + 2 = 14$).Solving Quadratic EquationsA quadratic equation has the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$. Common methods of solution include:Factorisation: Finding numbers that multiply to $ac$ and add up to $b$.Completing the Square: Rewriting the equation as a perfect square.Quadratic Formula: $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$Constructing a Quadratic Equation from Given RootsIf the roots of a quadratic equation are $p$ and $q$, the equation can be formed using:$$(x - p)(x - q) = 0$$Which expands to:$$x^2 - (p + q)x + pq = 0$$Example:If the roots are 3 and -2:$$(x - 3)(x + 2) = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 - x - 6 = 0$$Applications of Quadratic EquationsQuadratic equations are used in many real-life situations, such as calculating areas, analysing motion, and solving optimisation problems in business. By expanding and solving the equation, possible values of $x$ can be found and used to determine dimensions or quantities.Graphs of Linear and Quadratic FunctionsLinear functions of the form $y = mx + c$ produce straight-line graphs.Quadratic functions of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ produce parabolic graphs that are U-shaped.Understanding GraphsGraphs visually represent the relationship between variables. Important features include:Coordinates: Each point on a graph has both an $x$ and $y$ value.Roots (x-intercepts): Points where the graph meets or touches the $x$-axis.Tables of Values and Plotting Quadratic GraphsTo draw a graph, create a table of values by substituting different $x$-values into the equation to calculate corresponding $y$-values. Plot these points and join them smoothly to form a curve.Finding Roots from Quadratic GraphsFor quadratic graphs, the roots are the values of $x$ where the curve intersects the $x$-axis, that is where $y = 0$.Graphical Solution of a Linear and a Quadratic EquationWhen a linear equation and a quadratic equation are graphed together, the points where the graphs intersect represent the solutions that satisfy both equations.Tangents to Curves and Finding GradientsA tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at exactly one point without crossing it. The gradient of the tangent shows the rate of change at that point. To find it:Draw the tangent at the required point.Use two points on the tangent and apply:$$\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}$$Linear InequalitiesLinear inequalities include expressions such as $ax + b < c$ or $ax + b \ge c$. Solving inequalities follows the same steps as equations, except that multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.Example:Solve $2x + 3 < 7$.Subtract 3: $2x < 4$.Divide by 2: $x < 2$.On a number line, place an open circle at 2 and shade to the left.Graphical Solution of Linear Inequalities in Two VariablesFor inequalities such as $y < 2x + 1$, the solution is a region of ordered pairs.Steps:Draw the boundary line by changing the inequality into an equation.Use a solid line for $\le$ or $\ge$, and a dashed line for $<$ or $>$.Test a point (e.g., $(0,0)$) and shade the appropriate region.Graphical Solution of Simultaneous Linear InequalitiesTo solve a system of inequalities:Plot each inequality on the same graph.Shade the solution region for each one.The overlapping shaded area represents the solution.Example:Solve $y \le 2x + 1$ and $y \ge x - 2$.The solution is the region where both shaded areas overlap.Algebraic FractionsAlgebraic fractions contain algebraic expressions in the numerator, denominator, or both. Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Fractions with Monomial DenominatorsAddition/Subtraction: Use a common denominator if necessary.Multiplication: Multiply numerators and denominators directly.Division: Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction.Fractions with Binomial DenominatorsAddition/Subtraction: Find a common denominator, usually the product of the binomials.Multiplication: Multiply numerators and denominators directly.Division: Invert the second fraction and multiply.Functions and RelationsA relation shows a connection between sets of values, while a function is a special relation where each input corresponds to exactly one output.Types of FunctionsOne-to-One Function: Each input produces a unique output.Example: $f(x) = 2x + 1$One-to-Many Relation: One input corresponds to more than one output; this is not a function.Example: A student linked to multiple subject grades.Many-to-One Function: Different inputs may give the same output.Example: $f(x) = x^2$, since 2 and -2 both give 4.Many-to-Many Relation: Multiple inputs relate to multiple outputs and this is not a function.Example: Students enrolled in several courses.Functions as MappingsA function can be viewed as a mapping from a domain (set of inputs) to a codomain (set of outputs). If $x$ is in the domain, then $f(x)$ is in the codomain.Finding the Rule of a FunctionTo determine the rule of a function from a mapping:Match each input with its output.Identify the pattern connecting them.Write the rule in algebraic form.Example:If the mapping shows that each input $x$ gives an output $3x + 2$, then the function is written as:$$f(x) = 3x + 2$$

Mathematics Stock NoteTopic 3: MensurationLengths and PerimetersMensuration involving lengths and perimeters deals with applying geometric properties and relationships between the dimensions of different figures to determine distances around shapes.Application of Pythagoras' TheoremPythagoras' theorem is used to calculate the length of a side in a right-angled triangle. It states that in a right-angled triangle:$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$where $c$ is the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ are the other two sides. This theorem is commonly applied in coordinate geometry to find the distance between two points.Sine and Cosine RulesSine Rule:The sine rule is used to find unknown sides or angles in a triangle. It states that:$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$where $a, b,$ and $c$ are the sides opposite angles $A, B,$ and $C$ respectively.Cosine Rule:The cosine rule is applied when two sides and the included angle are known, or when all three sides are given. It is expressed as:$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$$This rule allows the calculation of unknown sides or angles in non-right-angled triangles.Length of Arcs of CirclesThe length of an arc of a circle is calculated using the formula:$$L = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r$$where $L$ is the arc length, $\theta$ is the angle in degrees, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.Perimeter of SectorsA sector is a portion of a circle enclosed by two radii and an arc. The perimeter of a sector is found by adding the arc length to the lengths of the two radii:$$\text{Perimeter} = 2r + L$$Segments of CirclesA segment of a circle is the region bounded by a chord and its corresponding arc. The perimeter of a segment is obtained by adding the length of the chord to the length of the arc.Longitudes and LatitudesLatitude and longitude are used to locate positions on the Earth's surface.Latitude: Measures how far north or south a point is from the Equator, ranging from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$.Longitude: Measures how far east or west a point is from the Prime Meridian, ranging from $0^{\circ}$ to $180^{\circ}$.These measurements are essential in navigation, map reading, and calculating distances between places on the Earth using spherical geometry.AreasAreas can be found using general formulas or shape-specific formulas, depending on the figure involved.Triangles and Special QuadrilateralsTriangle: $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$Using Angles: $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin C$ where $a$ and $b$ are two sides and $C$ is the included angle.Rectangle: $\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}$Parallelogram: $\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}$Trapezium (Trapezoid): $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) \times h$Circles, Sectors, and SegmentsCircle: $\text{Area} = \pi r^2$Sector: The area of a sector is a fraction of the area of the circle, based on the central angle.Segment: The area of a segment is found by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the radii and chord from the area of the corresponding sector.Surface Areas of 3D ShapesCube: $\text{Surface Area} = 6a^2$Cuboid: $\text{Surface Area} = 2(lb + lh + bh)$Cylinder: $\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi r(h + r)$Pyramid: $\text{Surface Area} = \text{Base Area} + \frac{1}{2}(\text{Perimeter of Base}) \times \text{Slant Height}$Right Triangular Prism: $\text{Surface Area} = \text{Area of Bases} + \text{Area of Lateral Faces}$Cone: $\text{Surface Area} = \pi r(l + r)$Sphere: $\text{Surface Area} = 4\pi r^2$Areas of Similar FiguresFor similar figures, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. If the linear scale factor is $k$, then the area ratio is $k^2:1$.Areas of Compound ShapesTo calculate the area of a compound shape:Break the shape into simpler figures.Find the area of each individual shape.Add the areas together to obtain the total area.Relationship Between a Sector and a ConeThe curved surface of a cone can be formed from a sector of a circle. When the cone is opened out, the curved surface becomes a circular sector whose radius is the slant height of the cone, and whose arc length equals the circumference of the base.VolumeVolume refers to the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object. Each solid has a specific formula used to calculate its volume.Volumes of Common SolidsCube: $V = a^3$Cuboid: $V = l \times b \times h$Cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$Cone: $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$Right Pyramid: $V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times h$Sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$Volumes of Similar SolidsThe ratio of the volumes of similar solids is equal to the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. If the scale factor is $k$ then the volume ratio is $k^3:1$. For example, if each dimension is doubled ($k=2$) the volume increases by a factor of $2^3 = 8$.

They show you where one place is compared to another, and you always measure them in degrees starting from true North.Key Terms:Reference Direction: Bearings are always measured clockwise from the North. You write them as a three-digit angle, anywhere from $000^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$. For example, $090^{\circ}$ is East, $180^{\circ}$ is South, and $270^{\circ}$ is West.Types of Bearings:True Bearing: Measured from true North.Magnetic Bearing: Measured from magnetic North (which can be a bit different because of magnetic variation).Bearing Notation: You'll often see this written as "the bearing of point B from point A." It basically means you're standing at A, looking North, and turning clockwise until you're facing B.Direction Format: Angles are in degrees, but sometimes people use compass notation like $N30^{\circ}E$, which means you start at North and go 30 degrees toward the East.Applications: You'll find bearings being used all over the place—by ships, planes, surveyors, and for GPS. They help figure out both the direction and the distance between points on Earth.Calculating Angles and Distances Using BearingsWhen you're working with bearings, you need to know how to use them to find angles and distances between spots.Triangulation: You can estimate distances if you know the bearings and distances from a few known points.Finding Angles: If you have two bearings from the same spot, you can find the angle between them just by subtracting one from the other. It's basic geometry.Navigation Context: Pilots and sailors use this to plan their routes and figure out exactly where they are by checking their reference points.Angles and Intercepts on Parallel LinesWhen two parallel lines get crossed by another line (called a transversal), you get some specific angle relationships.[Note: Based on the diagram in the document]Alternate Angles: These form on opposite sides of the transversal line, tucked between the two parallel lines. They're always equal. For example, if line $l$ is parallel to $m$, then $\angle 1 = \angle 2$.Corresponding Angles: These are in the same relative position at each intersection. They're also equal. So, $\angle 3 = \angle 4$.Interior Opposite Angles: These are on the same side of the transversal but inside the parallel lines. They're supplementary, meaning they add up to $180^{\circ}$. So, $\angle 5 + \angle 6 = 180^{\circ}$.Intercept Theorem (Thales' Theorem):This theorem says that if two parallel lines are cut by two transversals, the chunks created on those transversals are proportional.$$\frac{AE}{EB} = \frac{CG}{GD}$$Basically, the ratio of the lengths on one line is going to match the ratio on the other.Triangles and PolygonsThis section covers the big ideas about triangles and polygons—stuff like angles, similarity, and special shapes.Angles in a TriangleSum of Angles: All the inside angles of a triangle always add up to $180^{\circ}$. If the angles are $A, B,$ and $C$, then $A + B + C = 180^{\circ}$.Exterior Angle of a Triangle: An outside angle (formed by extending one side) is equal to the sum of the two opposite inside angles. So, $D = A + B$.Congruent TrianglesDefinition: Two triangles are congruent if they're exactly the same size and shape.How to tell (Criteria):SSS (Side-Side-Side): All three sides match.SAS (Side-Angle-Side): Two sides and the angle between them match.ASA (Angle-Side-Angle): Two angles and the side between them match.AAS (Angle-Angle-Side): Two angles and a side that isn't between them match.Special Triangle PropertiesIsosceles Triangle: Two sides are the same length, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal.Equilateral Triangle: All sides and angles are equal. Every angle is $60^{\circ}$.Right Angled Triangle: One angle is $90^{\circ}$. The long side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse; the other two are called legs.Properties of Special QuadrilateralsParallelogram: Opposite sides are equal and parallel. Opposite angles are equal. Diagonals cut each other in half.Rhombus: All sides are equal. Opposite angles are equal. Diagonals cross at a $90^{\circ}$ angle.Square: All sides are equal, and all angles are $90^{\circ}$. Diagonals are equal and cross at $90^{\circ}$.Rectangle: Opposite sides are equal, and all angles are $90^{\circ}$. Diagonals are the same length.Trapezium/Trapezoid: Has at least one pair of parallel sides.Similar TrianglesDefinition: Triangles are similar if they're the same shape but not necessarily the same size. They have the same angles, and their sides are proportional.AA (Angle-Angle) Criterion: If two angles match, the triangles are similar.Side-Splitter Theorem: If you draw a line inside a triangle that's parallel to one side, it splits the other two sides proportionally.Angles in a PolygonSum of Interior Angles: For a shape with $n$ sides, use $(n - 2) \times 180^{\circ}$. For a pentagon ($n=5$), it's $3 \times 180^{\circ} = 540^{\circ}$.Exterior Angles: No matter how many sides a polygon has, the sum of its outside angles (one at each corner) is always $360^{\circ}$.CirclesCircles have their own set of rules for how chords, tangents, and angles work together.Circle TheoremsChords: A perpendicular line from the center of a circle to a chord splits that chord in half. Chords that are the same length are the same distance from the center.Angle at the Center: The angle an arc makes at the center is twice the angle it makes anywhere else on the circumference. $\angle AOB = 2\angle APB$.Angle in a Semicircle: Any angle sitting on the diameter is a right angle ($90^{\circ}$).Angles in the Same Segment: Angles coming off the same arc are equal. $\angle APB = \angle AQB$.Cyclic Quadrilaterals: Angles in opposite segments (opposite corners of a four-sided shape in a circle) add up to $180^{\circ}$.Tangents: A tangent line is always perpendicular ($90^{\circ}$) to the radius at the point where it touches the circle.Alternate Segment Theorem: The angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.Construction in GeometryThis is about making perfect shapes using just a compass and a ruler (straightedge).Bisectors: You can split an angle or a line segment exactly in half.Parallel and Perpendicular Lines: There are specific steps to draw lines that never meet or lines that cross at exactly $90^{\circ}$.Specific Angles: You can construct $90^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 45^{\circ},$ and $30^{\circ}$ using these tools. For $60^{\circ}$, you basically start an equilateral triangle. For $45^{\circ}$, you split a $90^{\circ}$ angle in half.Loci in GeometryA locus is just a set of points that follow a specific rule.Circle: All points a certain distance from a single point.Perpendicular Bisector: All points equidistant from two specific points.Parallel Line: All points a certain distance from a straight line.Angle Bisector: All points equidistant from two crossing lines.Coordinate Geometry of Straight LinesThe x-y plane is the playground for coordinate geometry.Origin: The point $(0,0)$ where the axes cross.Coordinates: Written as $(x, y)$. $x$ is horizontal, $y$ is vertical.Quadrants: The plane is split into four areas (I, II, III, IV) based on whether $x$ and $y$ are positive or negative.Distance Formula: To find the distance $d$ between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$Midpoint Formula: To find the exact middle:$$M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)$$Gradient (Slope): The steepness of a line.$$\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}$$

Mathematics Stock NoteTopic 5: TrigonometrySine, Cosine, and Tangent of an AngleTrigonometric functions relate the angles of a triangle to lengths of its sides. The principal functions in trigonometry are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan).Definitions:Sine (sin): For a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$Cosine (cos): The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$Tangent (tan): Tangent of an angle: That is, an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$$Sine, Cosine, and Tangent of Acute AnglesAcute angles are angles less than $90^{\circ}$. Common values include:$30^{\circ}$: $\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{2}$, $\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\tan(30^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$45^{\circ}$: $\sin(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $\cos(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $\tan(45^{\circ}) = 1$$60^{\circ}$: $\sin(60^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\cos(60^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{2}$, $\tan(60^{\circ}) = \sqrt{3}$Tables of Trigonometric RatiosTrigonometric tables list values of sine, cosine and tangent for commonly encountered angles: $0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$. The tables are useful in a situation when no calculators are available.Sample:Angle0∘30∘45∘60∘90∘sin0$\frac{1}{2}$$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$1cos1$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\frac{1}{2}$0tan0$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$1$\sqrt{3}$undefinedSine, Cosine, and Tangent of Angles from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$Quadrant I ($0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$): All trigonometric functions are positive.Quadrant II ($90^{\circ}$ to $180^{\circ}$): sin is positive, cos is negative, tan is negative.Quadrant III ($180^{\circ}$ to $270^{\circ}$): sin is negative, cos is negative, tan is positive.Quadrant IV ($270^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$): sin is negative, cos is positive, tan is negative.Trigonometric Ratios for Special AnglesAt $0^{\circ}$: $\sin(0^{\circ}) = 0$, $\cos(0^{\circ}) = 1$, $\tan(0^{\circ}) = 0$At $90^{\circ}$: $\sin(90^{\circ}) = 1$, $\cos(90^{\circ}) = 0$, $\tan(90^{\circ}) = \text{undefined}$At $180^{\circ}$: $\sin(180^{\circ}) = 0$, $\cos(180^{\circ}) = -1$, $\tan(180^{\circ}) = 0$At $270^{\circ}$: $\sin(270^{\circ}) = -1$, $\cos(270^{\circ}) = 0$, $\tan(270^{\circ}) = \text{undefined}$At $360^{\circ}$: $\sin(360^{\circ}) = 0$, $\cos(360^{\circ}) = 1$, $\tan(360^{\circ}) = 0$Graphs of Sine and Cosine FunctionsGraph of $y = \sin(x)$ is periodic between -1 and 1 with period of $360^{\circ}$ or $2\pi$ radians starting from zero it reaches the maximum 1 at $90^{\circ}$ then goes to zero at $180^{\circ}$ further to minimum -1 at $270^{\circ}$ and back to zero at $360^{\circ}$.The graph of $y = \cos(x)$ also oscillates between -1 and 1. It starts at 1 at $x = 0$, reaches 0 at $90^{\circ}$, goes to -1 at $180^{\circ}$, back to 0 at $270^{\circ}$, and back to 1 at $360^{\circ}$.Graphs of Trigonometric RatiosAngles greater than $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ can also be graphically represented for trigonometric functions. Due to the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions, the graph repeats every $360^{\circ}$ or $2\pi$ radians.Graph of $\tan(x)$: Vertical asymptotes at odd multiples of $90^{\circ}$ are points at which the function is undefined. It is a graph that oscillates between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ and with a period of $180^{\circ}$, or $\pi$ radians.Angles of Elevation and DepressionAngles of elevation and angles of depression refer to trigonometric concepts related to how an angle is formed between a horizontal line and the line of vision to an object above or below that horizontal line.Definitions:Angle of Elevation: The angle between the horizontal level and the line of sight to an object that is above the horizontal level.Example: the angle between the ground and your line of sight to the top of a tree, when you stand on the ground and look up at a tree is the angle of elevation.Angle of Depression: The angle that is formed between the horizontal and the line of sight to the object, which is below the horizontal level.Example: let's say you are standing on a hill, and the car is parked downslope from you. The angle between the horizontal line (level with your eyes) and your line of sight to the car is the angle of depression.Angles of Elevation and Depression CalculationsTo solve for these angles, you can use the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine, and tangent. Which ratio to use depends on what you've been given—for example, lengths of sides.Example 1: Angle of ElevationProblem: A person standing 50 meters away from a building looks up at the top of the building. If the height of the building is 30 meters, what is the angle of elevation?Visualize a right triangle where:The opposite side is the height of the building, which is 30 m.The adjacent side is the distance between the person and the base of the building, which is 50 m.We are trying to find the angle of elevation.Applying the tangent function:$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{30}{50}$$$$\tan(\theta) = 0.6$$Solve for the angle:$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(0.6) \approx 30.96^{\circ}$$Example 2: Angle of DepressionProblem: A pilot flies over a landing strip at an altitude of 1000 meters. If the distance from the plane to the landing strip along the line of sight is 1200 meters, what is the angle of depression from the plane to the landing strip?Draw a right triangle where:The altitude of the flight is the opposite side (1000 m).The adjacent side is the distance from the plane directly to the ground and can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:$$\text{Adjacent} = \sqrt{1200^2 - 1000^2} \approx \sqrt{400000} \approx 632.46 \text{ m}$$Now use the tangent function:$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{1000}{632.46}$$$$\tan(\theta) \approx 1.58$$Solution for the angle:$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(1.58) \approx 57.99^{\circ}$$Application to Heights and DistancesAngles of elevation and depression find their application in day-to-day life to determine heights and distances in various fields like:Architecture and Engineering: Calculating the height of buildings or the angle for roof slopes.Navigation: These angles allow pilots and navigators to track their altitude and direction.Surveying: Trigonometric calculations are employed by surveyors to determine distances and elevations of land when mapping.BearingsDefinition: Bearings refer to a way of describing direction, commonly used in navigation and mapping. They describe the direction of one point from another and are measured in degrees from a reference direction usually from true North.Important Terms:Reference Direction: In bearings, the measurement is taken out in a clockwise direction from North. The bearing of a point is described by a three-figure number, between $000^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$. For example, a bearing of $090^{\circ}$ indicates East, $180^{\circ}$ indicates South, and $270^{\circ}$ indicates West.Types of Bearings:True Bearing: Measured from true North.Magnetic Bearing: Measured from magnetic North; this may be very slightly different from true North due to magnetic declination.Bearing Notation: Bearings are sometimes described as "the bearing of point B from point A". This notation means one is at point A and then one turns to face point B and calculates the angle.Direction: The angle is always expressed in terms of degrees and the angle may be written in compass format like $N30^{\circ}E$, which reads 30 degrees East of North.Uses: Direction bearings apply extensively in navigation—ships and aircraft, surveying, and geolocation. They calculate direction and distance between two points on the Earth's surface.Calculating Angles and DistancesIn using the bearings, one needs to know how to use them in order to be able to locate distances and angles of separation between two points:Triangulation: One can also estimate navigational distances by triangulation methods, from which, knowing the bearings and distances of a number of points, the position of that point can be determined.Angle Determination: Angles between bearings can be calculated with the aid of geometric principles. Suppose the bearings of two lines from a common point are known; the angle between those two bearings is obtained by subtraction of the two angles.Navigational Context: In navigation, one learns the relation between points with the use of bearings. It's possible to work out a route or the location of some place by first having a reference point then taking the bearings towards other points.

Mathematics Stock NoteTopic 6: Introductory CalculusDifferentiation of Algebraic FunctionsDifferentiation is a branch of calculus that measures how a function changes as its input varies. Put simply, it determines the gradient (slope) of the tangent drawn to a curve at a particular point. When dealing with algebraic functions, differentiation follows a set of established rules and formulas.Basic Rules of DifferentiationPower Rule:If $f(x) = x^n$ (where $n$ is any real number), then the derivative $f'(x)$ is given by:$$f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$$Constant Rule:If $f(x) = c$ (where $c$ is a constant), then the derivative is:$$f'(x) = 0$$Constant Multiple Rule:If $f(x) = k \times g(x)$, (where $k$ is a constant and $g(x)$ is a differentiable function), then:$$f'(x) = k \times g'(x)$$Sum Rule:If $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ then:$$f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)$$Difference Rule:If $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$ then:$$f'(x) = g'(x) - h'(x)$$Examples of Differentiation:Example 1: Differentiate $f(x) = 3x^4$Using the power rule: $f'(x) = 4 \cdot 3x^{4-1} = 12x^3$Example 2: Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^5 - 2x^3 + 4$Using the sum and power rules we have:$$f'(x) = 5x^{5-1} - 6x^{3-1} + 0 = 5x^4 - 6x^2$$Example 3: Find the derivative of $f(x) = 7x^2 - 5x + 9$Using again the power and constant rules we get:$$f'(x) = 14x - 5$$Higher-Order DerivativesSecond derivative, sometimes called $f''(x)$, is the derivative of the derivative:$$f''(x) = \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$It gives a measure of the rate of change of the rate of change of the function and provides information about concavity and curvature for the graph of the function.Integration of Simple Algebraic FunctionsIntegration is a fundamental concept in calculus and is essentially the reverse operation of differentiation. While differentiation focuses on determining rates of change or slopes, integration deals with finding accumulated quantities such as area under a curve.Basic Rules of IntegrationPower Rule:For any real number $n \neq -1$:$$\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$where $C$ is the constant of integration.Constant Multiple Rule:If $k$ is a constant:$$\int k f(x) dx = k \int f(x) dx$$Sum Rule:For any two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:$$\int (f(x) + g(x)) dx = \int f(x) dx + \int g(x) dx$$Definite Integral:The definite integral from $a$ to $b$ of a function $f(x)$ is given by:$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$$where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative (indefinite integral) of $f(x)$.Derivations and Derived FunctionsDifferentiation is the measure for the rate at which a function changes w.r.t. its variable and gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point. If $y = f(x)$ be a given function, then its derivative at $x$ is denoted as $f'(x)$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and it represents the gradient of the curve at $x$.The derivative, also known as the differential coefficient, expresses the relationship between small changes in the input and the resulting changes in the output.Standard Derivatives of Some Basic FunctionsSome standard derivatives of basic algebraic functions follow:For $y = x^2$: $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$If $s = 2t^3 + 4$ (where $s$ is distance and $t$ is time):$$\frac{ds}{dt} = 6t^2$$Here, $v = \frac{ds}{dt}$ represents velocity.Applications to Real-Life SituationsMaximum and Minimum Values:Derivatives are used to find maximum and minimum values of functions, which are essential in optimization problems such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.Rates of Change:Derivatives describe how physical quantities change over time, including speed, acceleration, and population growth.Concept of IntegrationIntegration represents total accumulation, such as the area under a curve, distance covered, or total revenue earned over time.Indefinite Integrals:An indefinite integral represents a family of functions differing only by a constant:$$\int 2x \, dx = x^2 + C$$Definite Integrals:A definite integral gives a numerical value representing the area between two limits.Example:$$\int_{1}^{3} 2x \, dx$$This is evaluated as:$$[x^2]_1^3 = 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8$$

Mathematics Stock NoteTopic 7: Statistics and ProbabilityStatisticsStatistics, being a sub-discipline of mathematics, provides ways of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. The following are summaries of some crucial concepts in statistics entailing frequency distribution, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion.Frequency DistributionA frequency distribution is the organization of data in categories or intervals with indication of the number of times each value or range of values occur. Frequency distribution is generally used in presenting information in the format of tables, where Classes or intervals are given with frequencies which show the numbers of responses falling into each class.Example of a frequency distribution of test scores could be as follows:Score RangeFrequency0-10511-201021-301531-407GraphsPie Charts: Circular chart that is divided into sectors, with each sector accounting for a proportion of the whole. The format is useful to show the size of items compared to the total.Bar Charts: Data are presented as rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is determined by the frequency value of each category. Bars may be oriented vertically or horizontally.Histograms: Similar to bar charts but used for continuous data. Bars show the intervals or bins of values; the height of the bar reflects frequency of data falling into that particular range of values.Frequency Polygons: A line graph connecting the midpoints of top of bars of a histogram. This pictorially represents distribution of data.Measures of Central TendencyMeasures of central tendency describe the central or typical value in a data set. They indicate where most values in the data are concentrated. The main measures include:Mean:The mean is the arithmetic average of a data set. It is found by adding all the data values and dividing the total by the number of observations.$$Mean = \frac{\Sigma x_i}{n}$$where $x_i$ is each value and $n$ is the total number of values.Median:The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the number of observations is odd, the median is the central value. If the number is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.Mode:The mode is the value that appears most often in a data set. A data set may have one mode, more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all.Mean, Median, and Mode for Discrete and Grouped Data:For discrete data, the mean, median, and mode can be calculated directly from the raw values. For grouped data, the mean is usually found using class midpoints, while determining the median and mode requires the use of cumulative frequency and specific formulas.Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive)An ogive is a graph that represents cumulative frequency. It is drawn by plotting cumulative frequencies against the upper class boundaries and joining the points with a smooth curve. This graph shows how many observations lie below a particular value.Measures of DispersionMeasures of dispersion describe how spread out the data values are.Range:The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.$$\text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum}$$Interquartile Range (IQR):The interquartile range measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is calculated as:$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$Semi-Interquartile Range (SIQR):The semi-interquartile range is half of the interquartile range and is given by:$$SIQR = \frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}$$Variance:Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. For a sample, it is calculated using:$$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$where $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean.Mean Deviation:Mean deviation is the average of the absolute differences between each value and the mean. It indicates how much the data deviates from the average value.Standard Deviation:The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It shows how far, on average, data values lie from the mean.$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$ProbabilityProbability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events occurring. It provides a numerical measure of uncertainty and is widely used in fields such as science, engineering, and finance.Experimental and Theoretical ProbabilityExperimental Probability:This probability is determined from actual experiments or observations. It is calculated as:$$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}}$$For example, if a coin is tossed 100 times and heads occurs 55 times, then:$$P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{55}{100} = 0.55$$Theoretical Probability:Theoretical probability is based on equally likely outcomes in an ideal situation. It is calculated as:$$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$$For instance, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die is:$$P(3) = \frac{1}{6}$$Addition of ProbabilitiesMutually Exclusive Events:Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. For example, rolling a 3 and rolling a 5 on a single die cannot both happen together.$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$$Independent Events:Events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the other. Tossing a coin and rolling a die are examples. For independent events:$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$$If the events are also mutually exclusive, then $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$.Multiplication of ProbabilitiesFor independent events, the probability that both events occur is found by multiplying their probabilities:$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a die and getting heads on a coin is:$$P(4 \text{ and Heads}) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{12}$$Vectors and TransformationsVectors in a PlaneA vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. In a plane, vectors are represented as directed line segments. They are widely used in mathematics, physics, and engineering.A vector can be illustrated as an arrow drawn from one point to another. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude, while the arrowhead shows the direction.Cartesian Components of a VectorIn a Cartesian coordinate system, a vector can be described using its horizontal and vertical components:$$\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$$It can also be written using unit vectors as:$$\vec{v} = v_x i + v_y j$$Magnitude of a VectorThe magnitude of a vector is found using the Pythagorean theorem:$$|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$$The magnitude depends only on the length of the vector, not its direction.Equal VectorsTwo vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and the same direction, regardless of their positions in the plane.Addition and Subtraction of VectorsAddition:Vectors can be added by combining corresponding components:$$\vec{u} + \vec{v} = (u_x + v_x, u_y + v_y)$$Subtraction:Subtraction is performed by subtracting corresponding components:$$\vec{u} - \vec{v} = (u_x - v_x, u_y - v_y)$$Zero VectorThe zero vector has zero magnitude and no specific direction. It is written as:$$\vec{0} = (0, 0)$$It acts as the identity element in vector addition.Parallel VectorsTwo vectors are parallel if they act in the same or exactly opposite directions. In component form, vectors are parallel if their corresponding components are proportional.Scalar MultiplicationMultiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude. A positive scalar keeps the direction the same, while a negative scalar reverses it:$$k\vec{v} = (kv_x, kv_y)$$Transformations in the Cartesian PlaneTransformations involve changing the position, size, or orientation of points or shapes based on specific rules. The main types are reflection, rotation, translation, and enlargement.ReflectionReflection flips a point or shape across a line known as the mirror line.Reflection in the x-axis: $(x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)$Reflection in the y-axis: $(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y)$Reflection in the line $y = x$: $(x, y) \rightarrow (y, x)$For shapes, each vertex is reflected using the same rule, producing a mirror image.RotationRotation turns a shape about a fixed point called the center of rotation. For rotation about the origin through an angle $\theta$ anticlockwise:$$(x', y') = (x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta, x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)$$For clockwise rotation, the signs of the trigonometric terms change accordingly. If the center of rotation is not the origin, the shape is first translated to the origin, rotated, and then translated back.TranslationTranslation moves a shape a fixed distance in a given direction. Each point moves the same amount.Translation by vector $(a, b)$:$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + a, y + b)$$EnlargementEnlargement changes the size of a shape while preserving its shape. Each point moves closer to or farther from a fixed point called the center of enlargement, depending on the scale factor.UnitsLength1000 millimetres (mm) = 100 centimetres (cm) = 1 metre (m).1000 metres = 1 kilometre (km).Area10,000 square metres ($m^2$) = 1 hectare (ha).Capacity1000 cubic centimeters ($cm^3$) = 1 litre (l).Mass1000 milligrammes (mg) = 1 gramme (g).1000 grammes (g) = 1 kilogramme (kg).1000 kilogrammes (kg) = 1 tonne.CurrenciesThe Gambia - 100 bututs (b) = 1 Dalasi (D)Ghana - 100 Ghana pesewas (Gp) = 1 Ghana Cedi (GH₵)Liberia - 100 cents (c) = 1 Liberian Dollar (LD)Nigeria - 100 kobo (k) = 1 Naira (₦)Sierra Leone - 100 cents (c) = 1 Leone (Le)UK - 100 pence (p) = 1 pound (£)USA - 100 cents (c) = 1 dollar ($)French Speaking territories: 100 centimes (c) = 1 Franc (fr)
